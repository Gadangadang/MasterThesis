\section{2 lepton training for bump search testing}

The 3 lepton + $e_T^{miss}$ dataset has less events, and thus allows for less training of the neural networks. 
Thus, the 2 lepton + $e_T^{miss}$ dataset was tried as well. The event selection was done choosing atleast 
2 leptons, meaning that the RMM signatures of some of the events will look similar to the RMM signatures of 
the 3 lepton + $e_T^{miss}$ dataset. A consequence of this is that the signal samples for the 3 lepton case 
would be a good start point for testing. The signal region for the regular autoencoder models were created by 
calculating the median $m_{err}$ of the reconstruction error. Then, 3 cuts were made, starting at 
$m_{err} + im_{err}/5$ for $i = 1,2,3$. As the shape of the background reconstruction error has a hill like 
shape, the median is a good place to start to remove alot of the background. This is however just a guess 
for an optimal signal region, as the true signal is unknown, and the method has to be as unbiased as possible. 
Below are some of the results from training on the 2 lepton case, using the same two SUSY signals as test cases.

In figure \ref{fig:AE_2lep_recon_err_both_sig} we have the reconstruction error distributions 
for the 2 lepton + $e_T^{miss}$ dataset for the regular autoencoder models. There is a general 
trend here for both the small and large regular autoencoder, which is that the distribution is 
highly shifted to the lower end of the reconstruction error range. This is a continuing trend 
following the 3 lepton + $e_T^{miss}$ shown in figure 
\ref{fig:AE_3lep_recon_err_both_sig}. This indicates that as we increase the statistics, 
in other words the amount of background events, the ability of the autoencoder to learn the 
internal structure increases. It is also interesting to observe here that 
as the reconstruction error increases, the amount of each sample in a given bin changes alot. 
As expected, Zmmjets and Zeejets along with ttbar are the events with the highest statistics 
in the 2 lepton + $e_T^{miss}$ dataset, thus it should be easier to learn to better reconstruct 
those events. However, note the amount of Diboson in the higher end of the reconstruction 
rror histograms, as well as in the $e_T^{miss}$ post reconstruction error cut distributions. 
One explanation for this could be the sample discrepency explained in section 
\ref{sec:mcdatacomp}. It would appear that too much of the diboson samples is cut, leading to 
not enough samples for it to appropriatly learn the RMM structure for that channel, leading to 
the high reconstruction error values for some of those events. Note also here that the 
reconstruction threshold where this effect is getting more notisable around $10^{-2}$ and 
larger, where the events are on the order of a 1000 or less per bin. Thus it is not alot of 
events, but still enough to note. \par Using the signal region definition from above we set 
cuts on the reconstruction error and then calculate the significance of the signal. 
The figures with the best significance are shown below:

In figure \ref{fig:AE_2lep_recon_err_both_sig_cut_etmiss} we have the $e_T^{miss}$ distributions for the best cuts for the regular autoencoder models.
The cuts then gives rise to the significance for each signal region. Now, one indication that the method could work is if the models can improve the 
significance from just looking at the $e_T^{miss}$ distributions of the background and the signal in mind. The significances corresponding to each 
reconstruction error cuts are all listed below. Note here that for $e_T^{miss}$, no physics basedcuts have been used, but there are certain cuts 
that can increase the significance, so the results in the following table should be thought carefully of.

First, it should be noted that the significance for the $800p50$ signal model is a lot smaller than for the $450p300$ signal model, even though the separation shown in 
figures \ref{fig:AE_2lep_recon_err_both_sig} and \ref{fig:AE_2lep_recon_err_both_sig_cut_etmiss} would suggest otherwise. All though the peak in both signal models are 
fairly separated from the peak of the SM MC, the SUSY $800p50$ signal model is shifted a lot more. This is consistant with expectation, as that specific signal model 
has a lot of missing transverse energy, compared to even the other SUSY signal model. Now, The reason for the low significance is most likely the fact that the signal sample 
contains low statistics, in other words, the weights are just a lot lower, compared to the other signal sample. We also have to cases where the significance is $NaN$. 
This only happens in the case we use equation \ref{eq:significance_small}, and is either because the square root has a negative term inside it, or because the logarithm 
has a negative term inside it. \par

From figure \ref{fig:VAE_2lep_recon_err_both_sig} below we have the variational autoencoder output for the 2 lepton case.

In figure \ref{fig:VAE_2lep_recon_err_both_sig} we have the reconstruction error distributions 
for both SUSY signals for the small and large variational autoencoder. Here we observe that the 
peak of the distributions for the SM MC in all four cases are somewhat centered in the middle 
of the reconstruction error range, which differs from the steep slope we saw in figure
\ref{fig:AE_2lep_recon_err_both_sig}. Interestingly, we see here that the deepness of the neural 
network here plays a role, which is different from the regular autoencoder output, where both 
the small and large autoencoder made a steep slope shape of the SM MC reconstruction error 
distribution. The peak of the distribution here is slightly shifted to the left for the shallow 
autoencoder model, and slightly shifted to the right of the center with the deep autoencoder 
model. One possible reason for this somewhat Gaussian like distribution could be that the 
variational autoencoder, via the reparametization trick from section \ref{sec:reparameterization}, 
samples from a Gaussian distribution that has yet to be trained on enough data to produce a 
good enough error distribution. It could also be that the batch size is too large, and that 
the model has to train on smaller batches to get a better result. \par

In figure \ref{fig:VAE_2lep_recon_err_both_sig_cut_etmiss} we have the $e_T^{miss}$ distribution 
for the best cut for each signal. By best, it is meant the cut that gave the best significance.
 We see that the cuts are somewhat similar to the regular autoencoder, but with two key 
 differences. \par  First, because the peaks of the distributions from figure 
 \ref{fig:VAE_2lep_recon_err_both_sig} are so close, the cuts allowed for more background events 
 in the signal region. Here, as with the regular autoencoder output, $m_{err}$ was used, but was 
 not a good descriminator for the background events. One could perhaps make a new strategy for 
 setting the cuts in the event one has a "fat gaussian" shape. Still, because we set cuts based 
 on reconstruction error to mimimize the background in the signal region, if one does not have a 
 slope like shape, the results will be poor in comparison. \par Secondly, the background that remains 
 are slightly different from the signal region from the regular autoencoder. In the lower energy 
 range there is a large excess of Zeejets, Zmmjets and ttbar events that have a high reconstruction 
 error, which is not the case for the variational autoencoder, dominated by diboson events in all bins. 
 In the higher energy range, diboson are are largest contributer to the background, but the number 
 of bins are exceptionally smaller than the Zmmjets/Zeejets/ttbar events, by a magnitude of 3 at the most.
