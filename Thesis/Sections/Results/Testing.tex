\section{Non signal testing of the regular and variational Autoencoder}

\subsection*{Channel removing}

Both the large and small regular and variational autoencoder produced results, and are shown below. The Higgs, singletop and ttbar channels have been selected here, as they are 
from a physics stand point the channels that looks most unlike the other channels.

In figures \ref{fig:ae_big_channel_1} to \ref{fig:vae_big_channel_3} we have the reconstruction error distributions for the SM MC using 
Higgs, singletop and ttbar as signal samples for the small (to the left) and the big (to the right) regular and variational autoencoder. 
It is clear from figures that the reconstruction error distributions for the removed SM channel and the remainding SM MC are very similar. 
The same behavior is also shown for the other channels, which can found in appendix 2. All though the two models struggled to get a 
separation of reconstruction error distributions, the regular autoencoder seems to have a more shifted pattern of reconstruction to lower 
values than the variational autoencoder. In fact, the regular autoencoder's reconstruction error distribution peak is about 3 order of 
magnitude lower than the variational autoencoder's error distribution peak. There could be several reasons for this, one of which is that 
the variational autoencoder requires more input data to approximate the distribution, as well as the fact that the balance between the KL divergence and MSE loss 
can be difficult to handle\cite{kl_mse_balance}. This can lead to poor performance of the network. It should be notet that all though the 
three channels selected here, as well as the rest in appendix 2, do not differ that much from one another, and the hopes were not high that 
the networks would be able to separate the two distributions created. However it does provide us with a baseline, as well as insight for what 
to expect if we were to test on signals that looks a lot like some channels.

\subsection*{Altering of transverse momentum}
Altering the transverse momentum of some particles would in the extreme be anomalous and the hypothesis was that some of those trends would be
picked up by the autoencoder. Several scales for the transverse momentum were used, with the following results.
