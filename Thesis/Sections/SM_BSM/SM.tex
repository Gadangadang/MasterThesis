\section*{Limitations}
All though the standard model have had great success comparing with experiments,
there are still several problems not addressed by it. First and foremost, the standard model
as described above, does not and cannot explain gravity in a quantized way. There 
are models that try to address this problem, but they supplement the standard model,
and does not derrive it from it.
