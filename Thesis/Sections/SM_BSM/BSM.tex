\section{Proposal model}
Parity symmetry is suggested to be restored at high energies by the introduction of 
a right handed weak symmetry, leading to right handed weak charged bosons, $W_R^{\pm}$. 
These mediators, as with the rest, decays faster than the detection ability at CERN, thus 
evidence of such a boson would come from the detection of a heavy neutrino. Heavy neutrinos can 
be produced in proton proton collisions through either the right handed $W_R^{\pm}$ bosons or
the SM $W^{\pm}$ bosons.
