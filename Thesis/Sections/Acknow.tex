    To be blunt, this exercise is the equivalent of fishing in the dark, 
    with a blindfold on, with a net of an arbitrary size, 
in an ocean trying to not catch fish, but something else 
that may or may not look like fish that might or might not be in the ocean.}{\textit{Sakarias Frette | Spring 2023}}
