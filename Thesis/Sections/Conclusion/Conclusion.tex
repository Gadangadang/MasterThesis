The main goal of this thesis was to benchmark and investigate the performance and usage of
autoencoders in beyond standard model searches. The analysis and testing was done using 
n-tuples from ATLAS that was converted to python dataframe structures. We argued for using 
the Rapidity-Mass matrix as features in our input data, with 6 bjets and 6 ljets, and 6 
of each lepton. The original goal was to test and understand the performance in the case
where we have a 3 lepton + $e_T^{miss}$ final state. In testing it was shown that the 
performance was not too impressive, thus the choice was made to use the 2 lepton + $e_T^{miss}$ dataset which 
contains much more data. Due to the large size of the total dataset, we proposed a solution
where the natural distribution in the total set was conserved in smaller batches, called 
megasets. Several tests were deviced to benchmark the autoencoders, 
making anomalous events by altering the $p_T$ of standard model events and testing on two 
supersymmetric signal models.
