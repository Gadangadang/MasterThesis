\chapter*{Neural Networks}
There are several categories of statistical algorithms for data analysis within machine learning.
Amongst them are neural networks, which have for the last decade exponentially been used
within industry and academia for a number of usecases. From image analysis to weather prediction,
these models are used extensively. \par
Neural networks, or feed forward neural networks (FFNN), are based on a few principles.
First, the data is feeded forward through the network. The end output is evaluated in some fashion, 
and corrections are then back propagated through the network, updating the weights and biases. 
This "training" is done until a sufficient threshold is met.
