\section*{Anomaly detection}
Anomaly detection is a tool with a wide range of uses, from time series data, fraud detection or anomalous sensor data. 
Its main purpose is to detect data which does not conform to some predetermined standard for normal behavior. 
The predetermined standard varies from situation to situation, both from the context it self and what is expected as an anomaly. 
Anomalies are typically classified in three categories \cite{anom_detec}:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Point anomalies
    \item Contextual anomalies
    \item Collective anomalies
\end{enumerate}

Point anomalies are singular or few outliers from a larger contect or group.
