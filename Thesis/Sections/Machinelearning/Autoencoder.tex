\section*{Autoencoders}
Autoencoders are a subset of neural networks. Whereas a general neural network
 in principle can take any shape, autoencoders are more restrictive.
This restrictiveness can in its most general sence we condensed 
into the following points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Same number of output categories as input categories  
    \item A latent space with smaller dimensionality than the input/output layer  
\end{itemize}
What we end up with two funnel shaped parts linked together. The two funnels are 
called the encoder (left funnel) and decoder (right funnel) respectively. This architecture is not 
accidental, but rather designed with a very specific solution of ploblems in mind, reconstruction. 
A good example to illustrate this is image denoising. Suppose you have a noised image, 
and want to denoise it. By feeding the encoder a noised image, and comparing the decoder output 
to the actual image, the autoencoder can tune itself to denoise images.
