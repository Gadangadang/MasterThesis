\chapter*{Autoencoders}
Autoencoders are a subset of neural networks. Where as a general neural network in principle can take any shape, autoencoders are more restrictive.
This restrictiveness can in its most general sence we condensed into the following points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Same number of output categories as input categories  
    \item A latent space with smaller dimensionality than the input/output layer  
\end{itemize}
What we end up with two funnel shaped parts linked together.
