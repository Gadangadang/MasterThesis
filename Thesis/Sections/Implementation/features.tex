\section{The dataset features}

\subsection*{The RMM matrix}
Most of the features in the analysis are elements in the so called Rapidity-Mass matrix (RMM)  inspired by the work of Chekanov \cite{Chekanov_2019}.
\par
The RMM is a convenient structure to create a feature space for the dataset. It contains information about mass, rapidity, momenta and energy, 
all of which are useful in searches for new physics\cite{Chekanov_2021}. One example of an analysis that have used some of the features from the RMM 
is demontrated in \cite{Santos_2017}. The main reason however for using this structure is the systematic layout and automated featurespace,
that maintains low to no corrolation between the cells in the matrix, as this is ideal when using neural networks
\par
Its composition is determined as a square matrix of $1 + \sum_{i=1}^{T}N_i$ columns and rows, where T is the total number of objects (i.e jets, 
electrons etc.), and $N_i$ is the multiplicity of a given object. In the case of the same number of a given object for all objects, we can 
denote the RMM matrix as a TmNn matrix, where m is the multiplicity of T, and n is the number of particle per type. Thus there is already 
room for evaluation, as the combination of number of objects and the number of each object type highly affects the analysis as well as 
computational resources. Each cell in the matrix contains information about either single og two particle properties. An example is 
shown in matrix \ref{eq:rmmmatrix}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:rmmmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
    \boldsymbol{e}_{T}^{miss} & m_T(j_1) & m_T(j_2) &  m_T(e_1) &  m_T(e_2)\\
    h_L(j_1) & \boldsymbol{e_T}(j_1) & m(j_1, j_2) & m(j_1, e_1) & m(j_1, e_2)\\
    h_L(j_2) & h(j_2, j_1) & \delta \boldsymbol{e_T}(j_2)& m(j_2, e_1) & m(j_2, e_2)\\
    h_L(e_1) & h(e_1, j_1) & h(e_1, j_2) & \boldsymbol{e_T}(e_1) & m(e_1, e_2)\\
    h_L(e_2) & h(e_2, j_1) & h(e_2, j_2) & h(e_2, e_1) & \delta \boldsymbol{e_T}(j_2)\\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

In matrix \ref{eq:rmmmatrix} we have the RMM matrix for a T2N2 system, in other words we have two types of particles, jets
\footnote{Jets here can both be b- or ljets. Ljet is defined as jets with jetdl1r < 0.665, where as bjet77 is defined as jets with jetdl1r>=2.195, 
EXPLAIN WHAT THIS FEATURE MEANS. } and electrons, where each type has two particles. The matrix itself is partitioned into three parts. 
The diagonal represents energy properties, the upper triangular represents mass properties, and the lower triangular represents longitudal 
properties related to rapidity. The diagonal has three different properties, $\boldsymbol{e_T^{miss}}$, $\boldsymbol{e_T}$ and $\delta\boldsymbol{e_T}$. 
$\boldsymbol{e_T^{miss}}$ is placed in the $(0,0)$ position in the matrix. It accounts for the missing energy for the system, which is of high interest 
for this analysis due to the search for heavy neutrinos. $\boldsymbol{e_T}$ is the transverse energy defined as 
\begin{equation*}
    \boldsymbol{e_T} = \sqrt{m^2 + p_T^2}
\end{equation*}
but for light particles such as electrons, this can be approximated to $\boldsymbol{e_T} \approx p_T$. $\delta\boldsymbol{e_T}$ 
is the transverse energy imbalance. It is defined as 
\begin{equation*}
    \delta\boldsymbol{e_T} = \frac{E_T(i_n-1) - E_T(i_n)}{E_T(i_n-1) + E_T(i_n)}, \, n = 2, ..., N.
\end{equation*}
The first columm in the RMM matrix, with the exeption of the first element, is related to the longitudal property of the given particle. 
It is defined as
\begin{equation*}
    h_L(i_n) = C(\cosh{(y)} - 1),
\end{equation*}
where C is a constant to ensure that the average $h_L(i_n)$ values do not deviate too much from the ranges of the invariant masses 
of the transverse masses, found to be $0.15$\cite{Chekanov_2019}. y is the rapidity of the particle, and $i_n$ is the particle number. 
On the lower triangle we have the longitudal properties of the combinations of particles. Similar to $h_L(i_n)$, this property is defined as 
\begin{equation*}
    h(i_n, j_k) = C(\cosh{(\Delta y)} - 1),
\end{equation*}
where $\Delta y = y_{i_n} - y_{j_k}$ is the rapidity difference for particle $i_n$ and $j_k$. 

\subsection*{Implementation of the RMM matrix}
An example of the RMM matrices used in this thesis is shown in figure \ref{fig:rmm_singular_events} below:


\begin{figure}[h!]

    \begin{subfigure}{.8\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/rmms/rmm_event_6993776_diboson4L.pdf}
        \caption{RMM matrix for event number 6993776 from the MonteCarlo diboson4L sample. Each feature is scaled based on a fit for that feature for

        \label{fig:rmm_zee_event}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}{.8\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/rmms/rmm_event_11739638_higgs.pdf}
        \caption{ RMM matrix for event number 11739638 from the MonteCarlo Higgs sample. Each feature is scaled based on a fit for that feature for

        \label{fig:rmm_higgs_event}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill        
    \caption{Note here that the y axis for the RMM's lack every other label, due to lack of space. Thus each figure have all RMM cells, 
    just not all y axis labels.  }
    \label{fig:rmm_singular_events}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:rmm_singular_events} we see two RMM matrices created from two different channels in the MonteCarlo samples. 
This RMM is of type T4N5\footnote{T4 $\to$ 4 particle types: bjets, ljets, electrons and muons. N5 $\to$ 5 particles per 
particle type. Note here that we have 5 particles only for the leptons, and 6 particles for each of the types of jets.}. 
These RMM matrices have scaled the features that a minimum value less than $-3$ and or a maximum value of above $3$. These 
scalers were fitted to the specific value using the "$.fit\_transform()$" and "$.transform()$" functions from the 
Scikit-learn library\cite{scikit-learn}. For easier interpretability, the gray area corresponds to a missing value, 
leading to so called "islands" in the RMM matrix.


\subsection*{MonteCarlo and data comparison}\label{sec:mcdatacomp}

Before we can start the analysis, we need to compare the MonteCarlo and data. This is done to ensure that the training samples we 
use are actually useful. As described by R. Stuart Geiger et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2107-02278}, the concept of "Garbage 
in, garbage out" is of key importance in computer science, and indeed important in high energy physics. To ensure that the models 
we train actually learns physical processes, the training set must represent the physics "status quo". If the training samples do 
not match the physical reality, we regard it, in the context of high energy physics, as garbage in, which will in turn give 
garbage out. The Monte Carlo standard model simulations are indeed very good, but the are numerical approximations, and can 
sometimes be off. Thus, every feature that well be used for training have to be checked before being used. This is done by 
comparing the distributions of the features in the MonteCarlo and ATLAS data. Assuming that there are no issues with the data 
collection from ATLAS, we then assume that the data from ATLAS is the "ground truth", as it is the only dataset we can analyze, 
and the only dataset we can compare to. The MonteCarlo is then compared to the data, and if the distributions are similar, 
we can assume that the training samples are good enough.

        \caption{Missing transverse energy for the three lepton final state. The histogram contains the entire Run 2 dataset.}
        \label{fig:etmiss}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}{.6\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/MC_Data_comp/flcomp.pdf}
        \caption{Flavor combination for the three lepton final state. This histogram only contains the flavor combinations for the good leptons, 
        denoted $lep_{SG}$. The histogram contains the entire Run 2 dataset. }
        \label{fig:flcomp}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill        
    \caption{Comparison of the MonteCarlo and data for the three lepton final state with the features $e_{T}^{miss}$ and flavor composition.
    }
    \label{fig:MC_Data_comp}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:MC_Data_comp} two features have been selected to vizualize the comparison between Monte Carlo and ATLAS data, $e_T^{miss}$ 
and $flcomp$. We see that both $e_T^{miss}$ and $flcomp$ satisfy a good ratio between Monte Carlo and ATLAS data, thus we can safely 
move forward with the analysis. All features were checked, and can be found in the Github repository for this thesis under the folder 
\href{https://github.com/Gadangadang/MasterThesis/tree/main}{Figures/Histo\_var\_check}.
