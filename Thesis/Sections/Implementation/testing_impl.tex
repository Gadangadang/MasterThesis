\section*{Initial testings}
Before testing the AE and VAE on signal samples, it was of interest to test the sensitivity of the
two models on alterings on the Monte Carlo. This can be thought of as initial testing. 
\subsection*{Channel removing}
Removing one channel in the standard model and using it as a signal whilst training on the remainding channels, 
\subsection*{Altering transverse momentum}
changing the transverse momentum on certain particles, 

\subsection*{Feature shuffling}
creating fake events by shuffling some of the features
