\section{The search strategy}
The strategy used to look for anomalies in the three lepton + missing energy finals state is presented as follows. First, the MonteCarlo and ATLAS data 
for training and inference are constructed with the RMM from section \ref{sec:rmm} as features. After scaling and splitting, $80\%$ of the MC will be used for 
training the neural network, and the remaining $20\%$ will be used for inference. To separate the anomalies, the reconstruction error of the input data 
will create a distribution. The same will then be done for a test signal, and eventually the ATLAS data. The ATLAS data is completely unlabeled which 
makes validation difficult. However, the test signals are labeled, thus we can analyze the reconstruction error distribution of those signals as a 
weak\footnote{Weak means here that allthough the test signals can provide valuable insight in how the autoencoder can separate anomalies,
 we must be cautious about generalizing the evaluation value of those results. There are many contributing factors that affect the reconstruction error separation, 
 which will be such as similiarities with the Standard model, large amounts of missing energy, high energy particles and more,  discussed in chapter \ref{Chap:results_discuss}. } 
 validation of performance when later running on ATLAS data. To avoid bias by the author, 
some of the test signals should contain some signal samples that the creator of the model has not seen before, to ensure no changes have been made 
 to the network to adjust for that signal. ROC curves will then be used to evaluate the binary classification ability of the autoencoder.
