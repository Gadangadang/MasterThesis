\epigraph{Not only is the Universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think.}{\textit{Werner Heisenberg}\cite{heisenberg}}
So goes the quote by Werner Heisenberg, acclaimed for his work in quantum physics in the early to mid 
20th century. The quote is a reminder and a statement of the fact that the world we live in is immensly 
strange, beautiful, complex and interesting. From the fundamental particles to the largest galaxy clusters, 
the universe is a place of wonder and mystery. It is perhaps easy to forget what science tries to do
when studying nature. Its fundamental duty is to model the universe as well as possible given the tools 
available. These models gets better over time, but unlike what scientific absolutists might think and 
argue for, we will never know the whole truth. One should always remember Heisenberg's quote, for it
illustrates the very point that nature is indeed stranger than we can think. Science with its 
predictive power is only an approximation, one can never truly know if the model we have of nature is 
a hyperfitted model or the actual instruction manual for nature itself. \par 
As physicists, we develop 
and extend, replace and debunk models at the most fundamental level of nature, one of which is
the Standard Model (SM). At higher energies, it is the most accurate, experimentally tested model to date,
only rivalled by general relativity. From the 1930s to around 1973, there were huge leaps within the field
of particle physics. Even then, the SM leaves several important questions unadressed. Dark matter, dark energy
and the energy density are phenomena that we observe around us but cannot be answered by the SM. 
Attempts have been made to create theoretical frameworks that could extend the SM with the strange behavior, 
but all have yet to be experimentally verified. One could ask oneself why 
this is the case. Why is this New Physics, what ever it may look like, so difficult to find? 
Is the framework wrong? Are the theories not well enough understood or wrong? Or it could be that
the New Physics is hiding within the data already collected, in some set of features, too subtle for
traditional analysis techniques, but available through advanced data analysis tools? The answer is, perhaps not to 
anyone's shock, we have no idea. In fact, they may all be true or false.\par 
This story does not end here, as there are countless departments all 
over the world searching for this New Physics. The ATLAS experiment at CERN is one organization that 
has taken upon itself this task, including my supervisors Professor Farid Ould-Saada and 
Dr. James Catmore working on searches for New Physics at the University of Oslo. This thesis will take a somewhat different search 
approach than conventional analyses done at ATLAS. In a humble attempt, the assumption is made that 
if the New Physics exist, it is too subtle for existing analysis techniques, and that it is hiding in the data
in some set of features. Further, it is assumed that by focusing on data we can label and that we know 
from experiment to exist, deviations from this would be of interest for more narrow searches. The hope is 
to filter out the events of interest, that with some certainty differs from the established theory, 
and then try to understand them better. \par 
In the last decade, data analysis tools such as neural networks have become more and more available 
to the public, getting optimized, upgraded and extended more computationally powerful every 
day. Google's Tensorflow\cite{tensorflow-whitepaper} and Facebooks PyTorch\cite{paszkepytorch} 
are two increasingly popular frameworks that are used within industry, 
academia, and even within the particle physics community. Tensorflow was chosen for this thesis, and 
all the neural networks are using this framework, together with several other third party pieces of software. \par 

\subsubsection*{Outline of the Thesis}
The master thesis is outlined in the following way. The first two chapters are dedicated to machine learning and
SM physics background required to understand the analysis done and tools used in the thesis. The third chapter goes 
through the implementation of the project, the input dataset, the ATLAS architecture, the programming libraries and
feature choice. Chapter four goes through the results from the implementation as well as discussion and 
interpretation of the results, the pros and cons of the implementation, aspects for future improvement, and other thoughts around the process.
The final chapter is dedicated to the conclusion, were the results are summarized.
