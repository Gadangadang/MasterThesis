    This endeavor resembles casting a line into the abyss, a murky world 
shrouded in darkness. With vision obscured and a net of unknown scale, 
the pursuit is not of fish, but of a nebulous entity that may or may 
not bear resemblance to its aquatic counterparts, if it exists in 
the briny deep at all.}{\textit{ChatGPT | Spring 2023}}
