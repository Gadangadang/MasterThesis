# MasterThesis

This is the repo containing the entire thesis project, from the codebase, figures and latex code, as well as the thesis itself.
The structure of the repo is as follows. <br>
### CodeBase
The tree structure is as follows:
```bash
|-- CodeBase
|   |-- Analysis
|   |   |-- GridSearches
|   |   |-- tf_models
|   |   `-- Utilities
|   |-- myNtupAnalysis
|   |   |-- CalcGenericMT2
|   |   |-- jupyter-notebooks
|   |   |-- MMinputfiles
|   |   |-- PHYSLITE
|   |   |-- plotting
|   |   |-- RDataFrameAna
|   |   `-- syst_studies
```

CodeBase contains two folders, "Analysis" containing code for the analysis itself, and "myNtupAnalysis" with contains code for event selection. <br>
The myNtupAnalysis folder contains premade code written by Dr. Eirik Gramstad, and modified by me for this thesis.

### Figures
The tree structure is as follows
```bash
|-- Figures
|   |-- histo_var_check
|   `-- testing
|       |-- histo
|       |   |-- big
|       |   |   |-- MinMax
|       |   |   `-- Standard
|       |   `-- small
|       |       |-- MinMax
|       |       `-- Standard
|       |-- model_plots
|       `-- rmm

```


### Thesis
```bash

|-- Thesis
|    |-- Figures
|    |   |-- atlas
|    |   |-- Machinelearning
|    |   |-- MC_Data_comp
|    |   `-- SM
|    |-- Sections
|    |   |-- Abstract
|    |   |-- Appendix
|    |   |-- Conclusion
|    |   |-- Implementation
|    |   |-- Introduction

|    |   `-- SM_BSM    
|    |-- Setup
```
